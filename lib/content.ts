export const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much does garage door repair cost in California?",
    a: "Garage door repair costs in California typically range from $150 to $600, depending on the mechanical issue and required parts. Minor work such as sensor alignment or track cleaning may cost approximately $75–$150, while torsion spring or motor replacement may range from $300–$800.\n\nPricing can vary by location, parts and labor. Coastal markets such as Los Angeles and San Francisco may be 20–30% more expensive than inland areas.\n\nCalifornia Garage Door Repair provides a clear estimate before any work begins.",
    note: "Pricing is provided for general reference only. Final cost depends on inspection, parts and site conditions.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it cheaper to repair or replace a garage door?",
    a: "In most cases a targeted repair — such as a spring, roller or opener fix — is far more cost-effective than replacement. We recommend full replacement only when a door is structurally damaged, badly corroded or beyond safe operation. Your written estimate will lay out both options so you can decide.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are your service hours?",
    a: "We operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including weekends and holidays, across California. Emergency dispatch is always available at (818) 369-8144.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is it dangerous to replace garage door springs yourself?",
    a: "Garage door springs are under extreme tension and store enough energy to cause serious injury if they release unexpectedly. Proper replacement requires winding bars, correctly rated springs and trained technique. Our technicians are factory-trained and fully insured to do this safely.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does homeowner's insurance cover garage door repairs?",
    a: "It depends on the cause. Damage from a covered event such as a storm, vehicle impact or vandalism is often eligible, while normal wear and tear typically is not. We can provide detailed documentation and photos to support an insurance claim.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which garage door brands do you service?",
    a: "We service all major brands, including C.H.I., Clopay, LiftMaster, Amarr, Craftsman, Genie, Sommer, Marantec and Hörmann, along with most opener and gate systems.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does a garage door repair usually take?",
    a: "Most common repairs are completed within 45 minutes to 2 hours on the same visit, thanks to our fully stocked service trucks. Larger installations may be scheduled for a dedicated appointment.",
  },
  {
    q: "Where can I find garage door service near me?",
    a: "We serve homes and businesses statewide — from Los Angeles, San Diego and Orange County to the Bay Area, Sacramento and the Central Valley. Enter your ZIP code above to confirm availability and find your nearest technician.",
